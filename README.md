Image Sizes
=================

This is an old Pascal application that I created around November 2003.

Runs in Windows 7.

I recommend using Dev-Pascal (http://www.bloodshed.net/devpascal.html) to compile, as it's what I used originally (and now).

Original readme
===============

	Image Sizes v1.0
	Created by James Skemp - http://jamesrskemp.net/
	Created using Pascal (Dev-Pascal)
	Tested in Windows 98 SE

Source code available upon request.

Images Sizes was created to be a tool to find an appropriate number to fit within a ratio.

For example, if you want to find out what the number that matches 768 is in a 4x3 ratio, you can run this program for a 4x3 ratio with 768 entered as your number.  You would then get the matching number for both positions (1024x768 as well as 768x576).

Current limitations:

- Runs in MS-DOS, and therefore lacks an interface of sorts
 
- Again, lacks a pretty interface ;)
 
- Only allows input and output of integers (no numbers like 4.3).  However, Image Sizes v1.0 tests for the output of a non-integer value and lets you know about this.  Since most people that would ever use this are looking for pixel size ratios, this isn't really a limitation.  However, I would like to, in another version, give some other values that fit in with the entered ratio.

Comments regarding this program are greatly appreciated.  You can find my email at the web site listed above.  Thank you for using and testing my program.
